# linode\_nodebalancer\_node

Provides a Linode NodeBalancer Node resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes NodeBalancer Nodes.
For more information, see [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-node-balancer-node).

The Linode Guide, [Create a NodeBalancer with Terraform](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/create-a-nodebalancer-with-terraform/), provides step-by-step guidance and additional examples.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure NodeBalancer Nodes attached to Linode instances.

```hcl
resource "linode_instance" "foo" {
  count           = "2"
  label           = "web-${count.index + 1}"
  image           = "linode/ubuntu24.04"
  region          = "us-mia"
  type            = "g6-standard-1"
  authorized_keys = ["ssh-rsa AAAA...Gw== user@example.local"]
  root_pass       = "terraform-test"

  private_ip = true
}

resource "linode_nodebalancer" "foobar" {
  label                = "mynodebalancer"
  region               = "us-mia"
  client_conn_throttle = 20
}

resource "linode_nodebalancer_config" "foofig" {
  nodebalancer_id = linode_nodebalancer.foobar.id
  port            = 80
  protocol        = "http"
  check           = "http"
  check_path      = "/foo"
  check_attempts  = 3
  check_timeout   = 30
  stickiness      = "http_cookie"
  algorithm       = "source"
}

resource "linode_nodebalancer_node" "foonode" {
  count           = "2"
  nodebalancer_id = linode_nodebalancer.foobar.id
  config_id       = linode_nodebalancer_config.foofig.id
  address         = "${element(linode_instance.foo.*.private_ip_address, count.index)}:80"
  label           = "mynodebalancernode"
  weight          = 50

  lifecycle {
    // Tell Terraform to implicitly recreate the NodeBalancer node when
    // the target instance has been marked for recreation.
    // See: https://github.com/linode/terraform-provider-linode/issues/1224
    replace_triggered_by = [linode_instance.foo]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `label` - (Required) The label of the Linode NodeBalancer Node. This is for display purposes only.

* `nodebalancer_id` - (Required) The ID of the NodeBalancer to access.

* `config_id` - (Required) The ID of the NodeBalancerConfig to access.

* `address` - (Required) The private IP Address where this backend can be reached. This must be a private IP address.

- - -

* `mode` - (Optional) The mode this NodeBalancer should use when sending traffic to this backend. If set to `accept` this backend is accepting traffic. If set to `reject` this backend will not receive traffic. If set to `drain` this backend will not receive new traffic, but connections already pinned to it will continue to be routed to it. (`accept`, `reject`, `drain`, `backup`)

* `weight` - (Optional) Used when picking a backend to serve a request and is not pinned to a single backend yet. Nodes with a higher weight will receive more traffic. (1-255).

## Attributes Reference

This resource exports the following attributes:

* `status` - The current status of this node, based on the configured checks of its NodeBalancer Config. (`unknown`, `UP`, `DOWN`).

* `config_id` - The ID of the NodeBalancerConfig this NodeBalancerNode is attached to.

* `nodebalancer_id` - The ID of the NodeBalancer this NodeBalancerNode is attached to.

## Import

NodeBalancer Nodes can be imported using the NodeBalancer `nodebalancer_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Config `config_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Node `id`, separated by a comma, e.g.

```sh
terraform import linode_nodebalancer_node.https-foobar-1 1234567,7654321,9999999
```

The Linode Guide, [Import Existing Infrastructure to Terraform](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/import-existing-infrastructure-to-terraform/), offers resource importing examples for NodeBalancer Nodes and other Linode resource types.
