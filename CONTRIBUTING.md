# Contributing Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, we appreciate you taking the time to contribute! THANK YOU! :tada::+1:

We put together the handy guide below to help you get support for your work. Read on!

## I Just Want to Ask the Maintainers a Question

The [Linode Community](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/) is a great place to get additional support.

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report or Feature Request

Please open a [GitHub issue](../../issues/new/choose) to report bugs or suggest features.

Please accurately fill out the appropriate GitHub issue form.

When filing an issue or feature request, help us avoid duplication and redundant effort -- check existing open or recently closed issues first.

Detailed bug reports and requests are easier for us to work with. Please include the following in your issue:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made, relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
* Screenshots and code samples where illustrative and helpful

## How to Open a Pull Request

We follow the [fork and pull model](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) for open source contributions.

Tips for a faster merge:
* address one feature or bug per pull request.
* large formatting changes make it hard for us to focus on your work.
* follow language coding conventions.
* make sure that tests pass.
* make sure your commits are atomic, [addressing one change per commit](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
* add tests!
